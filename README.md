# Ikarus travel

My friend manages many tour sellers. They are using WhatsApp to make notes and let her know about the new reservation. Then she will fill the information from the message into a Google sheet where the manager and accounter can look into it to get the needed information.

She always works with bad emotions and goes to bed late. It's all about the cost and many situations when collecting tour data. I write this project to reduce the cost(time) and reduce the missing/conflict information.
